This is a work-in-progress project aiming constructing an easy to use recursive descent parser framework able to handle left-recursion. For details about handling left-recursion in recursive descent parser see [A New Top-Down Parsing Algorithm to Accommodate Ambiguity and Left Recursion in Polynomial Time](http://hafiz.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/pub/p46-frost.pdf) by Richard A. Frost and Rahmatullah Hafiz.
